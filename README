tem_multi_proxy is a tool that automatically creates a TEM proxy for each PC/SC
reader on the system. The tool reacts appropriately to PC/SC events like
readers being added or cards being inserted. It also re-spawns proxy processes
if they die.

The utility's intended use is for TEM clusters (systems with multiple TEMs
attached), where the TEM's auto-configuration mechanism wouldn't allow access to
all the TEMs.
 
Note on testing: since the proxy is entirely event-driven, testing it would be
a pain, or I don't know how to do it easily yet. Therefore I'm not going to
write complex tests for 200 lines of code that I don't expect to change ever
again. Contributions are welcome though :)
