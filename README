tem_multi_proxy is a tool that automatically creates a TEM proxy for each PC/SC
reader on the system. The tool reacts appropriately to PC/SC events like
readers being added or cards being inserted. It also re-spawns proxy processes
if they die.

The utility's intended use is for TEM clusters (systems with multiple TEMs
attached), where the TEM's auto-configuration mechanism wouldn't allow access to
all the TEMs.
